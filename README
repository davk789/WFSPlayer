WFSMixer is instantiated by running the command: WFSMixer();
all parameters should be set and retrieved from save and preference files.


WFSMixer -- an audio mixer that implements Wavefront Synthesis to spatialize sound along
a 2 dimensional plane. This will be able to mix external signals, along with custom 
SynthDefs that can be loaded with this set of SuperCollider classes.

***** notes:

/////// sequencer notes:

the sequencer will need to hold this data:
***timestamp
 the timestamp, when recorded, will be the time that the event was triggered, 
 after the recording started. So, the playback sequence will need to subtract the 
 next value from the last value played. I don't think there will be anything more 
 complicated than that, right?

*data:
 the location of the point in space -- the playback will move the location here
 the source channel being affected -- I made it possible to move single points
  in the marker area in order to facilitiate this.
   ... but how do I get this value? there are two ways to do this -- index in to an
       array, or a unique identifier in a Dictionary. because source channels can be 
       added and removed at will, then it is probably better to refer to an ID. The
       MarkerArea uses indexes, so I would need to implement a conversion algorithm, 
       or else change the MarkerArea to use Dictionaries -- I think the former is a
	   better idea



//////

a big part of this work will involve translating user parameters to the raw delay times
that will be set on each channel.
