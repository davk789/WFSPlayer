WFSPlayer -- an audio mixer that implements Wavefront Synthesis to spatialize sound along
a 2 dimensional plane. This will be able to mix external signals, along with custom 
SynthDefs that can be loaded with this set of SuperCollider classes.

Installation:

With git, run this command from the command line:

git clone git://github.com/davk789/WFSPlayer.git WFSPlayer

WFSPlayer depends on the XML Quarks, and will work with both SwingOSC and CocaGUI schemes.

Running:

Use something like this. The SynthDefs can be any mono signal. Their out buses must then
be set to the inBuses of their respective channels as follows:

~main = WFSMixer();

// the server will boot automatically. add two channels in the WFSMixer interface
// and then run the following code.

~ggOutBus = ~main.addChannel;
~pOutBus = ~main.addChannel;

// alternatively add a channel in the gui, and then call getInBus

~ggOutBus = ~main.getInBus(0);
~pOutBus = ~main.getInBus(1);

// to play back, then you would do something like this (or better to use
// Synth objects)
// obv. use your own SynthDefs here 
// *** NOTE the synths must be added to the head of group 1 ***

~ggNode = s.nextNodeID;
s.sendMsg('s_new', 'testWFS', ~ggNode, 0, 1, 'outBus', ~ggOutBus);
s.sendMsg('n_free', ~ggNode);
~pNode = s.nextNodeID;
s.sendMsg('s_new', 'wfsTestPulses', ~pNode, 0, 1, 'outBus', ~pOutBus);
s.sendMsg('n_free', ~pNode);


********** issues ***********

TODO:
programmatically load presets <-- ** is this necessary?
... wish list
add a global "loop" option to the sequencer
add drawing/algorithmic sequencing features
add vertical placement of audio signals
*** from Bryan
add draw paths to the markers that show where the markers go when played (no more info needed)
add more control over the sequences (clear, rename, delete sequences, etc.)


BUGS:
-noticeable delay artfacts when moving sound sources < adding a lag corrects this problem
... reported from bryan
WFSMixer:playAction is only called when launching the sequence -- on a loop, play is not retriggered
channel volume control appears not to work
"having trouble setting adding a channel and playing back a sound at the same time."
