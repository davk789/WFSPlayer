WFSMixer -- an audio mixer that implements Wavefront Synthesis to spatialize sound along
a 2 dimensional plane. This will be able to mix external signals, along with custom 
SynthDefs that can be loaded with this set of SuperCollider classes.

Installation:

With git, run this command from the command line:

git clone git://github.com/davk789/WFSPlayer.git WFSPlayer

Notes:

WFSMixer depends on the XML Quarks package, and SwingOSC.

It is possible to use WFSMixer with the Cocoa GUI. Simply alter the classes in the 
following project files, to inherit from the Cocoa counterparts to the SwingOSC classes
WFSMarkerArea, and WFSScrollingNumberBox.

util/WFSMarkerArea.sc
util/WFSScrollingNumberBox.sc
